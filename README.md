# cancer-detect-revisit
This project is a revisit to a grad project I undertook creating a CNN-based system for detecting breast cancer in RGB images; see the repo (CNN-CompVis). I initially could not improve the performance of my model at the time more than about 80% due to time and resource constraints, but let's see if we can do so now.
